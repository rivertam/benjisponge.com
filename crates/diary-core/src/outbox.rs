//! The device-local diary store: mirror and outbox in ONE table.
//!
//! On the phone this runs against `indxdb://` (SurrealDB's IndexedDB engine)
//! inside the service worker and the page; under `cargo test` it runs
//! against `mem://`. Nothing here knows which: every function takes the same
//! `Surreal<Any>` handle the site's server code uses, which is the point —
//! the logic is written once and exercised natively before it ships to wasm.
//!
//! The local `diary_entries` table holds the server fields (id, written_at,
//! body) plus local-only sync state: a queued entry is just a row with
//! `state = 'pending'`, a delivered one flips to `'synced'` in place, and a
//! permanently rejected one to `'failed'`. Ids are predicted locally with
//! the SAME probe-and-dedupe loop the server runs ([`crate::store`]), so an
//! entry's permalink is right from the moment it is enqueued and the page
//! reconciles bubbles by nothing more than "same id". Rows are never
//! deleted on delivery — that delete-before-report gap is what forced the
//! old page to keep a provisional-bubble machine.
//!
//! Deliberately no `Send` bounds on [`flush`]'s transport: on wasm the
//! injected future wraps a browser `fetch` and is `!Send`; natively the test
//! doubles are ordinary futures. Single-threaded wasm never needs `Send`,
//! and adding it would make the shared signature uncompilable there.
//!
//! The query shapes follow docs/surrealdb-notes.md: explicit projections
//! (because `SELECT *` omits `option` fields holding `NONE`), string keys
//! returned via `record::id(id)`, and one `=` per delete.
