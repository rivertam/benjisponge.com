# The local-first diary (client-side SurrealDB + topcoat SSR over wasm)

The /diary system is written in Rust on both sides of the wire, and the
larger idea it started as — Remix-style loader/clientLoader isomorphism for
a topcoat + SurrealDB app — is BUILT: one local table is both outbox and
mirror; Entry Keys are predicted at enqueue with the same probe
the server runs; the transcript markup is ONE set of pure components
rendered by the server page, by the service worker's offline SSR
(`Router::handle` inside the worker, the topcoat 0.5.0 serve split), and
cloned by the page JS from a served `<template>`; sync is flush-then-pull
through a two-method transport trait whose direct implementation wraps
another `Surreal<Any>` handle plus the remote server's validation clock. The
page JS cannot tell which renderer drew the HTML it reconciles against — that
sentence is the whole design.

## Shape

- `crates/diary-core` — everything shared. `entry` owns the canonical
  lifecycle values; `contract` owns the exact-epoch transport boundary and
  response/pull classification; `eastern` owns the America/New_York
  projection (Entry Keys derive from it); `placement` owns the shared
  probe-and-dedupe algorithm; `store` is its server persistence Adapter;
  `outbox` is its DEVICE-LOCAL Adapter and single store — mirror and queue
  in one `diary_entries` table, including snapshot reconciliation and the
  empty-snapshot wipe guard; `sync` only sequences flush then pull over the
  two-method `Remote` Interface (`HttpRemote` lives in the worker;
  `DirectRemote` wraps an authenticated `Surreal<Any>` plus the server time
  captured for that sync pass); `views` (feature "view") the PURE components —
  transcript, bubble, compose, template, minimal offline chrome — zero awaits,
  which is what satisfies topcoat's
  `+ Send` render bounds on wasm for free. All of it runs against the SAME
  `Surreal<Any>` handle `src/data.rs` uses. `cargo test -p diary-core`
  exercises everything natively against `mem://` (including two-device
  convergence walks and store-to-store direct sync); the phone runs the
  identical code against `indxdb://diary`.
- `crates/diary-worker` — the wasm binary: the store exports
  (`diary_enqueue/snapshot/discard/import`), `diary_sync` (one
  flush-then-pull pass; picks direct or HTTP transport), and
  `diary_render` — a serve-less topcoat router (`features = ["router",
  "view", "discover"]`, no hyper anywhere) whose `#[page]` fns render the
  mirror through the shared views; store reads bounce through
  `spawn_local` + a oneshot channel because render futures must be `Send`
  and indxdb futures are not. Deliberately its own cargo workspace,
  EXCLUDED from the root — see the patch section below. `just check` and
  CI never touch it: breakage surfaces at `just wasm` or the Docker
  wasm-builder stage. (The crate root is `cfg(target_arch = "wasm32")`-
  gated so a stray native build compiles an empty crate.)
- `src/app/diary.rs` — auth and routing glue over the SAME
  `diary_core::{store,views}` calls the worker makes, plus the flag-gated
  token mint. One definition of protocol, queries, and markup; a drift is
  a type error, not a silent half-parse.
- `src/app/diary_sync.rs` — serves `wasm-dist/` at three stable routes
  (see Serving below); its loader also carries the hashed asset URLs the
  offline SSR links and the direct-sync endpoint when flagged.
- `src/app/diary/sw.js`, `diary.js` — browser glue only: worker lifecycle,
  asset cache, Web Lock, Background Sync, BroadcastChannel, and the page's
  template-clone bubble handling keyed by `data-id`.

### Canonical diary-entry values

The Diary Entry Module owns the lifecycle values used at the persistence and
transport Seams:

- `EntryContent` owns the business fields that determine replay equality.
- `ComposedEntry` pairs `EntryContent` with the second proposed to placement;
  a same-device collision can re-anchor it to a later probed second.
- `DiaryEntry` carries the placement-selected record key and second; ordinary
  placed rows use an Entry Key, with the legacy recovery exception below.
- `SavedRef` is the server-confirmed identity, not another copy of content.
- `LocalEntry` wraps a `DiaryEntry` with device-only state, failure reason,
  and enqueue order.

Snapshots carry `Vec<DiaryEntry>` directly, and each flush result pairs a
queued id with its `SavedRef`. Persistence and transport Adapters carry these
values instead of declaring parallel wire, snapshot, and report entry shapes.
Adding a durable `EntryContent` field has four production field-list Seams:
`EntryContent`, the shared explicit `PROJECTION`, the next server migration,
and the next device migration. It does not add per-query binds,
write branches, snapshot mappings, compatibility DTOs, flush-report content,
placement or reconciliation comparisons, or CAS predicates.

Presentation was deliberately not deepened in this refactor. A field that is
composed or shown still needs feature-specific work in `views`, the served
bubble template, the plain form, and `diary.js`; those are presentation edits,
not another persistence or transport representation.

`CURRENT_SCHEMA_EPOCH` is the single compatibility number carried by
`ComposeCommand`, `PushWire`, `SnapshotWire`, HTTP sync headers, and direct
token grants. There are no older-entry DTOs or multi-generation readers. The
server requires an exact epoch on push, snapshot, and token requests and
answers any mismatch with 503; the worker classifies that as Retry, leaves the
outbox pending, and makes a mismatched snapshot a mirror no-op. The strict
envelopes carry the epoch too, so a newer worker also fails closed against an
older server that ignores the unfamiliar header.

Server migrations live under `src/data/diary_migrations/` with immutable
ledger rows in `diary_schema_migrations`. A fresh store applies them in order;
every server diary Adapter rechecks that ledger even on a cached connection,
so an older process refuses a database whose ledger is newer instead of
serving through obsolete code or permissions. Device migrations live under
`crates/diary-core/src/outbox_migrations/` and use the same ordered ledger in
the device-local database. Each schema change and its ledger row commit in one
transaction. The page and service worker hold the shared `diary-store` Web
Lock across every local epoch check and operation, so a stale context cannot
project, dedupe, or discard a newer row: it sees the newer ledger and pauses.
Current definitions reconcile on open; only the cheap legacy drain and
missing-CAS backfill remain standing before each flush.

Direct database sync carries the same epoch in the signed JWT. The
migration-owned table permission admits only the exact current claim. The
first migration has one narrow claimless bridge for an already-authenticated
pre-epoch session; current code never mints another. Because SurrealDB turns
permission-denied creates into empty successful results, the store Adapter
also requires CREATE to return the expected Entry Key before reporting
success.

Deployment is forward-only across an epoch. Drain the preceding web process
before allowing the new process's first diary request to apply the migration;
do not run two server epochs against one diary store. Migration SQL and its
ledger row commit atomically, and every later Adapter use rechecks the ledger,
but a database handle cannot revoke a request that already passed its check.
After the traffic handoff, the first data-backed request applies the ordered
migrations; the direct-token route explicitly opens that migrated handle
before minting. Cached stale workers fail their device check or receive Retry
until the new worker activates. Rolling back across an applied epoch requires
an explicit reverse migration and is not supported by a plain binary rollback;
an older binary detects the newer ledger and refuses the diary database.

Remote acceptance is one store Interface shared by the HTTP and direct
Adapters: it normalizes content, enforces the timestamp window and body bound,
then runs placement. The outbox deliberately applies only intrinsic queue
preparation (line normalization and nonempty content), so text that is too old
or too long is still durable locally and can become an in-place 422 failure.

## Stable ids and flush semantics

An entry's Entry Key is predicted at ENQUEUE by running the same bounded
placement algorithm the server runs. At every candidate key, identical Entry
Content dedupes and different content probes forward. A same-device collision
can therefore re-anchor the proposed second before the row is queued. The
predicted key is permalink-shaped immediately, which keeps local
reconciliation keyed by `data-id`, but it is not an Entry Reference until
delivery or a snapshot marks the Device Entry synced. A cross-device collision
can make the server's `SavedRef` bump the key and placement second again; the
device store re-keys the row and the pull that follows converges the mirror. In
the common case, proposed, predicted, and saved seconds agree.

An unprojectable timestamp from a legacy queue is the exception: its text is
kept failed under a synthetic `failed-*` Recovery Key. Recovery Keys are
device-only preservation handles, never Entry Keys, permalinks, or replyable
Entry References.

Flushes send oldest-first by enqueue time; stop on auth (401/404) or
retryable trouble (network, 400/403/5xx, captive-portal 200) so composition
order survives; schema-epoch mismatch is deliberately 503. Permanent
rejections (409/413/415/422) mark the
entry failed IN PLACE and keep its text for manual copy. A delivered entry flips
`pending -> synced` in place too — never deleted — so no snapshot can watch
a message blink out of existence mid-flush. `FlushReport.saved_refs` pairs a
local queued id with the server's identity-only `SavedRef`; it includes only
writes whose exact stored fingerprint transitioned, so a stale acknowledgement
can never mark a replacement row delivered. The mapping matters mainly for a
rare server bump, where the local row is re-keyed to the server's id (and if
that key is held by a DIFFERENT pending row, the delivered row is simply
released — its text is safe server-side and the pull that follows in the same
lock places it).

Each current device write stores a SHA-256 write fingerprint derived from its
whole canonical `ComposedEntry` and enqueue order. Delivery and rejection are
compare-and-swap transitions against that opaque token. A migrated tokenless
row receives a fresh opaque token without projecting its business fields. The
current page shares the worker's store lock, while the fingerprint also
protects against a predecessor context, a replaced write, and native callers
outside that browser lock. Because current canonical serialization feeds the
fingerprint, a future business field requires no new CAS predicate.

The immediately preceding single-store worker wrote the same rows without a
fingerprint. Every outbox open—and the selection before each flush—runs a
standing guarded backfill for missing tokens and drains the retired separate
outbox. Selection represents a still-missing token explicitly and retries the
backfill, so one late predecessor write cannot abort the whole flush or be
skipped while newer writes overtake it. Conditional updates plus bounded
conflict retry never replace a token another writer supplied.
The dashed queued styling and "will sync" label appear only when a report says
the queue is actually blocked; "failed" only when the server rejected the
entry.

`outbox::flush` takes the transport as a generic closure with deliberately
NO `Send` bounds: browser futures are `!Send`, native test futures don't
care, and wasm is single-threaded anyway. Adding `Send` there would break
the wasm build; this is the one signature where the isomorphism is fragile.

## Legacy migration

The pre-wasm queue (IndexedDB `diary-queue`/`entries`) is drained by the worker
on each flush, under the device-store Web Lock: read all → `diary_import` (idempotent
by its composition second plus legacy body, state/reason preserved, bodies
kept byte-for-byte) → delete legacy rows only after import returns. Its source
shape is frozen at `qid`, `written_at`, `body`, `state`, `reason`, and
`enqueued_at`; future Entry Content fields were never present there and must
default absent during import. A crash anywhere re-runs safely. The emptied
database is left behind for any straggler old worker. Page kicks are
deliberately unconditional (the old "any pending?" check is gone) because only
the worker can see both stores while the migration exists.

The retired wasm queue (`diary_outbox`, the separate outbox table before the
single store) drains the same way inside `outbox::open` and before each flush.
Its SurrealDB source
schema is likewise frozen at `written_at`, `body`, `state`, `reason`, and
`enqueued_at`; do not add later Entry Content fields to that legacy table.
Rows port into `diary_entries` under predicted keys (unprojectable timestamps
land under synthetic `failed-*` Recovery Keys as failed rows — never dropped),
then the old rows delete one by one. It is a STANDING step, not one-shot:
during deploy skew an old worker happily re-creates the table.

## Serving and cache pairing

`just wasm` (or the Dockerfile's wasm-builder stage) puts two artifacts in
`wasm-dist/`: `diary_sync.js` (wasm-bindgen `--target no-modules` glue) and
`diary_sync_bg.wasm`. They only work as a matched pair, so `diary_sync.rs`
never serves them unversioned to callers:

- `/diary-sync.js` — two-line loader, `no-cache`. Sets `self.DIARY_SYNC`
  with `?v=<hash>` URLs for the pair; the hash covers BOTH files.
- `/diary-sync-glue.js`, `/diary-sync_bg.wasm` — `immutable` only under the
  exact current `?v=`; any other query answers `no-cache` so a deploy race
  can never pin wrong bytes under a year-long key.

The service worker `importScripts` the loader and then the glue at
evaluation time (Chrome refuses new importScripts URLs after install), so a
loader byte change on deploy is also what triggers the worker update. There
is deliberately no try/catch around those imports: if the pair can't load,
this worker version fails to install and the previous working version keeps
running. The page loads the same two files via injected classic scripts and
falls back to the plain form POST when anything refuses — a dev checkout
without `wasm-dist/` behaves exactly like the no-JS diary.

Artifacts are read from disk per request with a file-stamp cache, not
`include_bytes!`: `just build` stays green without a wasm toolchain and a
running `just dev` picks up a fresh `just wasm` immediately. The immutable
variants are exactly what `response_layer.rs`'s signed-in exemption expects;
everything else stays `no-store` for cookie-bearing requests.

## Building

- `just wasm` — needs `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown` and
  `cargo install wasm-bindgen-cli --version 0.2.126 --locked`. The CLI
  version MUST equal diary-worker's pinned `wasm-bindgen` crate version;
  mismatches fail loudly at bindgen time.
- `.cargo/config.toml` passes `--cfg getrandom_backend="wasm_js"` for the
  wasm target only (getrandom refuses to guess a randomness source there).
- `[profile.wasm]` (in the worker's own manifest) is size-first
  (`opt-level = "z"`, fat LTO, `panic = "abort"`). Current output ≈19.1 MB
  raw / ≈5.1 MB gzipped — the embedded SurrealDB engine is the floor;
  topcoat's router+views added ≈0.6 MB and protocol-ws ≈0.25 MB.
  `wasm-opt -Oz` (binaryen) typically shaves another 20-30% and slots in
  after wasm-bindgen in the `just wasm` recipe if it's ever worth
  installing.
- The size is acceptable because only /diary loads it (one admin, installed
  PWA, immutable-cached per deploy). Do not load this module from any
  public page.

## The surrealdb-core wasm patch (temporary, load-bearing)

surrealdb-core 3.2.3 panics at runtime on wasm32-unknown-unknown: most of
the crate migrated to `web_time` for the browser, but three call sites
still reach `tokio::time::Instant::now()` and std's unimplemented
monotonic clock — `RuntimeError: unreachable`. `kvs/ds.rs` (the
`check_version` retry on every datastore open) kills the engine before the
first query; the TIMEOUT query operator dies when used; and
`kvs/tasklease.rs` (`tokio::time::sleep` takes an Instant internally)
kills every spawned background task — index compaction, event processing,
tombstone reclaim — with a console exception per task on each page load.
This is the unresolved half of upstream issue #6711; the official
`@surrealdb/wasm` package dodges it only by pinning an older core.

The fix here is deliberately shaped like the upstream PR it should become:
`deploy/surrealdb-core-wasm-time.patch` swaps those three files onto the
crate's own established `wasmtimer` pattern (see its `sleep` call sites),
behind `cfg(target_family = "wasm")` — native code is byte-identical.
(`dbs/executor.rs` has two more `tokio::time::timeout` calls, but both are
gated on a datastore `transaction_timeout` this build never configures;
they belong in the upstream PR, not in this minimal patch.)

Containment is structural, not procedural: `crates/diary-worker` is its OWN
cargo workspace, excluded from the repo root's, and the `[patch.crates-io]`
lives in the worker's manifest. The server workspace cannot see it — the
site always builds pristine crates.io code, and no root-workspace command
touches the vendor dir. `scripts/vendor-surrealdb-core.sh` (run by
`just wasm` and the Dockerfile) materializes `vendor/surrealdb-core`
(gitignored) from the sha256-verified crates.io tarball plus the patch; the
repo commits only the ~40-line patch file. When a surrealdb release fixes
#6711 fully: bump the workspace pin, delete the `[patch]` block, the
script, the patch file, and this section.

## Direct sync (flag-off by default)

With `DIARY_SYNC_JWT_PUBLIC_KEY` + `DIARY_SYNC_JWT_PRIVATE_KEY` +
`DIARY_DIRECT_SYNC_ENDPOINT` set (railway-deploy.md), the sync pass skips
the site's endpoints entirely: the worker POSTs `/api/diary/token` (admin
cookie; the app server's ONLY remaining role), opens a fresh short-lived
WEBSOCKET to the endpoint, `authenticate()`s, verifies the `$access` canary,
and then `sync::DirectRemote` pushes with the same `store::save_entry`
probe the server runs and pulls the same snapshot read — one algorithm, two
engines, natively tested store-to-store. Any failure arming the pass falls
back to the HTTP endpoints, so a half-configured flag never silences sync.

Load-bearing findings (probed on 3.2.3, tests + canaries pin them):

- The access method MUST be `TYPE RECORD WITH JWT` and the token MUST carry
  an `id` claim (`diary_device:admin`). Plain `TYPE JWT` sessions get a
  database-level Viewer role that reads EVERY table regardless of
  PERMISSIONS.
- The endpoint MUST be `ws://`/`wss://`. The stateless-http engine's
  `authenticate()` does not stick on server 3.2.3 — every later request
  arrives anonymous.
- SurrealDB filters permission-denied reads to EMPTY results instead of
  erroring, and permission-denied creates can likewise return an empty
  successful result. Four layers keep either from becoming data loss: the
  setup canary (`RETURN $access`), the exact JWT schema-epoch permission, the
  wipe guard (an empty snapshot never deletes a populated mirror), and a
  verified CREATE result before any save acknowledgement. Permissions change
  only in ordered diary migrations, and an older binary refuses a newer
  migration ledger. The initial migration alone admits a claimless token
  minted before epochs existed; the endpoint never mints another, and passes
  use fresh tokens with a 15-minute TTL.
- `jsonwebtoken` requires the private key as PKCS#8 PEM (`openssl pkcs8
  -topk8`), not SEC1 "EC PRIVATE KEY".

## What remains (all optional)

The original roadmap — direct client→SurrealDB, local-first reads, SSR in
the service worker — is fully shipped (2026-08-04, one branch, phased).
Leftover niceties, none load-bearing:

1. **`wasm-opt -Oz`** (binaryen) typically shaves 20–30% off the module;
   slots in after wasm-bindgen in `just wasm` if ever worth installing.
2. **Upstream topcoat PR** cfg-gating the `+ Send` bounds on
   `Component::render` / `PageRenderFn` for wasm32 — would retire the
   oneshot bridge in `diary-worker::ssr`, nothing else.
3. **Pull as `CHANGEFEED` + `SHOW CHANGES`** if the full-snapshot pull
   ever gets heavy (it is a personal diary; it will not soon). Changefeeds
   must stay server-side only — the wasm engine's changefeed GC has an
   open upstream issue (#6311).
4. **Live queries over the direct websocket** for real-time cross-device
   updates, if two devices ever compose at once in practice.
