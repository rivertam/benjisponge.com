//! Interest registry, mirroring `posts.rs`. Each interest is a standalone
//! page module under `app/interests/`; this list is the single source of
//! truth for its slug (top-level route `/{slug}`, nav label, rail stamp),
//! display title, and teaser (the index card copy, doubling as the page's
//! lede). The nav dropdown, the interests index, and the 404's route list
//! all derive from here — adding an interest means one entry here plus the
//! page module.
