//! A hidden page: not in `INTERESTS`, not in `site_routes()`, so the nav,
//! indexes, feed, and 404 never mention it publicly. Its one listing is
//! `access::HIDDEN_PAGES`, which the shell dropdown and the interests index
//! render for allowlisted viewers only. Signed-out visitors get bounced to
//! `/login`; signed-in visitors who aren't allowlisted for it get the real
//! 404. The `no-store` header goes out before `shell()` on every variant —
//! belt for the viewer layer's suspenders, and the reason a future cookieless
//! variant of this page could never be edge-cached for a day.
