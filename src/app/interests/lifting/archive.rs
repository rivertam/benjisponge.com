//! The fitness archive engine — everything behind `/lifting` and
//! `/api/fitness/*` that isn't a view: the Eastern projection, the
//! derived-records spec, import validation and its write path, the filter
//! grammar, and the in-memory snapshot that serves every read.
//!
//! Reads come from a [`snapshot`] of the whole archive rather than
//! per-request SQL: records are derived-not-stored (a `has_record` filter
//! that participates in counts and pagination has no SQL expression once
//! the `set_records` table is gone), and every SQLite-ism the old Worker
//! relied on (ASCII-only NOCASE, byte-order sorts, NULL-excluding
//! comparisons) has an exact pure-Rust mirror here but no faithful
//! Postgres collation. The database is read in full only when the data
//! version changes — an import, a few times a week.
//!
//! Error messages, envelope key order, and filter semantics are contract:
//! the golden fixtures under `tests/fixtures/api` capture the Worker's
//! originals verbatim. The sibling `models.rs` belongs to this interest
//! too but compiles inside the lib crate (see `src/data.rs`), and
//! `fitness_sync.rs` is its own binary (`Cargo.toml` `[[bin]]`).
