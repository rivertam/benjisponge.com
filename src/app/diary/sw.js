/* The /diary service worker (registered by diary.js with scope "/diary" —
 * public pages are never controlled). Two jobs:
 *
 * 1. Offline reads: when a navigation's network fetch fails, RENDER the
 *    page from the device mirror — the same Rust router and views the
 *    server runs, compiled to wasm (diary_render). Hashed assets and the
 *    versioned wasm pair ride a cache-first cache (immutable by contract);
 *    there is no cached-HTML copy anymore, the mirror is the offline copy.
 * 2. The write queue: one sync pass (flush then pull) against the JSON
 *    endpoints. The policy is Rust — crates/diary-core over a local
 *    SurrealDB (docs/diary-sync.md) — and this file is only the browser
 *    glue: import the module, hold the shared device-store Web Lock, migrate the pre-wasm
 *    IndexedDB queue, broadcast the report, and throw on retryable trouble
 *    so Background Sync retries with backoff. Syncing lives HERE and only
 *    here — pages enqueue and kick. The server dedupes replays through the
 *    same bounded probe walk and whole Entry Content; that is the replay
 *    idempotency guarantee, while the lock also fences local schema epochs.
